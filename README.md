### Notes

**Path bug**

If you get an error like:

```
SDK location not found. Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable or by setting the sdk.dir path in your project's local properties file at '/Users/<HOME_NAME>/Documents/GitHub/wallet/android/local.properties'.
```

duplicate `android/local.properties.example` as `android/local.properties` and set correct path
